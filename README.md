# Dynamic-Data-Logger-SDCARD
This project is a simple data logger for microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP32, STM32), which records sensor data to a CSV file on an SD card. The project demonstrates how to initialize the SD card, create unique log files, and write sensor readings to these files with timestamps. Great to add to a project that needs Data Logging.
